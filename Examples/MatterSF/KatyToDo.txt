To do:
1. Add a relaxation class which relaxes for chi during the relax time
2. Test this with an example
3. Write a BSSN class which can be used instead of the CCZ4 class, make a second SF example with this instead
4. Add another example for the inflationary scenario, using BSSN and some initial SF
5. Compare to some existing results
6. Make some notes on how to update things which may be useful for others (but not for public consumption)
