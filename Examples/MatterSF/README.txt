-Scalar Field Matter example
 ----------------------------
 -
 -This code takes an initial scalar field configuration at a moment of time symmetry, such that
 -the momentum constraint is trivially satisfied. It relaxes the value of the conformal factor chi 
 -in order to satisfy the Hamiltonian Constraint.
 -
 -phi is the field value
 -PiM is (minus) the conjugate momentum
 -
 -The initial conditions are specified in ../../InitialConditions/BubbleSF.hpp
 -The form of the potential is specified in ../../CCZ4Matter/EMTensorSF.hpp
 -The eoms are the CCZ4 formulation for the gravity sector, and the KG eqns in curved space for the field.
 -These can be found in ../../CCZ4Matter/CCZ4MatterSF.impl.hpp
