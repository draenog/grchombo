GRChombo has been compiled and tested with gcc-4.9 and higher and
intel icc-16.0.3 and higher. For icc note that the gcc compatibility has to be set to gcc-4.9 or higher.

GRChombo requires c++ standard 11 or higher so the compiler should be invoked with -std=c++11 (or higher)

This folder also contains specific install notes for a collection of machines GRChombo has been run on.

To compile:
Export CHOMBO_HOME (the path to the Chombo installation) and compile whathever example or test you want to
run by invoking make all DIM=3 (or 2,4,5... if you are thus inclined) -j 32 (compiles in parallel ... any number
will work but some are faster than others) in the relevant directory.
In addition, follow any other specific instructions for your machine in this folder.
