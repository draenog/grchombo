- WORK THROUGH COMPILE ERRORS ON COSMOS

- Compute classes should be changed to take SimulationParameters directly, not parameters. This might not seem like a
good idea at first sight but it makes it much easier to pass down parameters and thus makes it less tempting to hard code parameter values.

- Write the autogeneration of the SimulationParameters code

- Merge FABDriver and FABDriverBase. One doesn't need both!

- Tidy up the SetupAMRObject function by making a class BaseParameters and loading the variables there.

- Get rid of unneccessary clutter in the main file and the first function calls

- Fix the =0 constructor for a 2 tensor

- Think about and sort out tagCells.

- Make sure the FArrayBox::setVal functions are threaded in Chombo

- Write unit test for EnforceTfA
