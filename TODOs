- Write the autogeneration of the SimulationParameters code

- Merge FABDriver and FABDriverBase. One doesn't need both!

- Tidy up the SetupAMRObject function by making a class BaseParameters and loading the variables there.

- Get rid of unneccessary clutter in the main file and the first function calls

- Think about and sort out tagCells!

- Make sure the FArrayBox::setVal functions are threaded in Chombo

- Add SIMD functions like cos and exp

- Write unit test for EnforceTfA

- Compute classes should be changed to take SimulationParameters directly, not parameters. This might not seem like a good idea at first sight but it makes it much easier to pass down parameters and thus makes it less tempting to hard code parameter values.
